|                                        Props                                        |                     State                     |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------: |
| Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument. | State holds information about the components. |
|                                Props are immutable.                                 |               State is mutable.               |

   <View style={{padding: 10}}>
     <TextInput

   </View>
 );
}

export default PizzaTranslator;

```
